# frisbee-teams

Utility to generate MUFA teams, based on the infamous 21-point scale. Handles baggages.

Implemented using a genetic algorithm, to refine teams ad nauseum. Extending supported players stats should be pretty straightforward - just add them to the Player object and the fitness() function.

To run, simply download the code and do an `npm start`. Depends on react & redux.
